# Interactive World Building Simulation Game ðŸŒ„

## Overview

This is a simulation sandbox game that enables players to build and manipulate a dynamic virtual world. Inspired by titles like *Cities: Skylines*, this project emphasizes core mechanics such as environmental interaction, object placement, and real-time lightingâ€”developed in C++ using OpenGL.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid System**: Clickable and camera-aware grid for placing objects in the world.
- **World Objects**: Buildings, vegetation, rivers, and moreâ€”supporting dynamic size and placement.
- **Lighting & Shadows**: Day-night cycle with real-time Phong lighting and dynamic shadows.
- **Fluid Simulation**: Realistic behavior for water bodies like rivers or lakes.
- **User Creativity**: Encourages exploration of emergent behaviors through environmental interaction.

## Technologies

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL
- **Rendering Techniques**:
  - Phong Lighting Model
  - Shadow Mapping
  - Real-time Rendering
- **Simulations**:
  - Fluid Dynamics (for rivers/lakes)
